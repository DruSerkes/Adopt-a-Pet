# Adopt-A-Pet  

This is my Adopt-a-Pet project for Springboard 

***  

### What was this project about?  

The purpose of this project was to get practice working with Flask-WTForms in tandem with Flask-SQLAlchemy.  


### What I did  

I defined a Pet model for my PostgreSQL db with Flask-SQLAlchemy. I also made a PetForm model for my FlaskForm (to utilize WTForms with Jinja). 

I then defined routes for my app to Creat, View, and Update Pets. I made use of WTForms with Jinja to create forms to both add and edit a pet, including making use of csrv tokens for form validation.


### Looking forward  

I would like to revisit this app to filter pets by whether or not they are available, and implement functionality for deleting a pet as well (full CRUD).
